College Nurse
: The College Nurse, [Kate Tempest](http://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/kate-tempest)
([email](mailto:nurse@exeter.ox.ac.uk)) can give treatment for all sorts of minor problems,
give advice on more serious ones, arrange prescriptions and help with
stress management.

College Doctors, ☎ [01865 240501](tel:01865240501)
: The College Doctors are at 19 Beaumont Street, Oxford.
General surgery hours are **8.30-12.30** and **2-6** Monday to Friday;
Saturday **9.30-11** for urgent problems only. You can make routine
appointments with them or any of their partners. Consultations with doctors
are free, but if they give you a prescription to have filled at a pharmacy,
this will cost you approximately £7.
: Contraception is available free from the doctors or at the Alec Turnbull
Clinic on Cowley Road. A condom machine is located at the bottom of
Staircase 6. Limited emergency supplies will be kept in the MCR loo
cabinet. Rape alarms are available from the Welfare Officer upon request.

Dentists
: Ox Brookes run a dental clinic called Studental and they have agreed to
allow all students from the university to go there for check ups and more
urgent work.
: The government has abolished registration so when you phone for an appointment
you just need to say which college you are from and to take your student
card with you as proof.
: There are leaflets about Studental outside the college nurse's room.
