### *President*, <a href="mailto:president@exetermcr.org">Esther Kwan</a>

### *Vice President*, <a href="mailto:vice-president@exetermcr.org">Emily Dolmans</a>

Emily came to Oxford in 2011 to complete an MPhil in Medieval English Literature, and enjoyed it so much that she is staying on to pursue a DPhil, looking at regional identity in the literature of post-Conquest Britain. She can often be found enveloped in the folds of one of Exeter MCR's armchairs, working on her thesis or chuckling at some of the delightful marginalia found in medieval manuscripts. In her spare time (such as it is) she enjoys travelling, hiking, photography and indulging in contemporary novels.

### *Treasurer-Elect*, <a href="mailto:treasurers@exetermcr.org">Myriam Frenkel</a>

### *Treasurer*, <a href="mailto:treasurers@exetermcr.org">Francisca Gale</a>

My name's Francisca (like Francisco with an 'a' at the end, funnily
enough, or Fran) and I'm from the Isle of Man, but I promise I won't
siphon the MCR's funds into a trust or company based there. In a
previous academic life, I studied German and Modern Greek at King's
College London, whence I came to Exeter/Oxford in 2010 to specialise in
medieval German literature.  I'm now writing a doctoral thesis on the
poetics of adaptation as evidenced by various twelfth- and
thirteenth-century narrative texts.  I can usually be found sitting in
the MCR in the chair next to the kitchen.
