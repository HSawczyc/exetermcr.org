                        <br>I’m currently studying for my DPhil in Philosophy and this is my 6th year in Oxford. What I love most about Exeter College is the welcoming atmosphere. I have experienced nothing but kindness and generosity on all fronts, from my fellow graduate students to the JCR, scouts, kitchen staff, fellows and porters. Compared to other colleges, our MCR is a lovely size where there are still plenty of people to meet, but a comforting sense of closeness amongst the members. We have forged a great number of ties with other graduate common rooms across Oxford, resulting in many joint social and welfare events. Exeter MCR is truly unique within the university and I’m honoured to have the opportunity to make a significant

                        <br>Hi I’m Christy, one of the social secs for Exeter MCR. I work with the other social secs to organise events such as exchange dinners with other colleges, wine & cheese nights, bar crawls and much more! It’s my job to make sure you get the best social experience at Exeter!
                        <br>I’m currently in my first year of a DPhil in Theoretical Computer Science, and have a really great experience so far at Oxford. Exeter is a truly remarkable place, that is both welcoming and very active. We have a fantastic MCR, and are always striving to improve, and make it an even better place to be.
                        <br>Georgie
                        <br>My name is Georgie and I'm one of the MCR Social Secretaries. I am currently studying for a Master's in Slavonic Studies (don't worry, no one knows what that means). I love languages, travelling music and literature. Having come to Oxford as a graduate, not knowing what to expect, I was bowled over by the kindness and openness of Exeter. I instantly felt welcome and all my preconceptions about Oxford students flew out the window. I have met the most wonderful people and had so much fun experiencing everything Oxford has to offer. Exeter has a buzzing atmosphere and there's always something going on. I want to give back to the MCR and make sure future graduate students have the same great experience I did when I arrived here.
                        <br>As social secretaries, our job is to organise, plan and run all the social events for the MCR. These events are a key part of the graduate experience here at Exeter, as they provide a break from the stresses of academic life at Oxford and allow you to enjoy the social aspect of being in a close- knit college community. We want these events to be both fun and inclusive, so that they bring all corners of the MCR together. We want to make sure everyone is getting the most out of their time at Exeter and feels part of the Exeter family. This is why we organise a range of social events, from formal dinners, wine and cheese nights and parties in the MCR, to ice skating, punting trips and summer barbecues. 
                        <br>We want you all to have the time of your lives at Exeter, because let's face it, you're not going to remember the books you read or the essays you wrote- you're going to remember the fun you had and all the friends you made. It's our job to make sure that happens.

I endeavour to stop stuff from breaking, buy new stuff, and allocate the lockers. My background is in history and theology, and I, for now, work in Oxford. 
                        <br>From the Big Gay Party to names for some of the appliances, Exeter continues to have an MCR with idiosyncrasies only possible from it having a spirited graduate body often around College.

                        <br>I am a DPhil student studying neurochemical changes in the brain during motor learning. Exeter has such a welcoming and friendly MCR, here you will always find someone to talk to!
                        <br>As Equalities Rep, I am the first point of contact for information and advice on issues concerning equality (LGBTQ+, disability, ethnic minorities, etc.) and for anyone worried about discrimination or harassment. I distribute information on university-wide LGBTQ events and LGBTQ events happening within Exeter College.
                        <br>I also work closely with the Welfare Officers to organise and run regular events aiming at promoting equality in the MCR, such as the consent workshops. Additionally, we provide various welfare supplies including sexual health products and sanitary products confidentially and completely free of charge to members of the MCR.
                        <br>My job and interest is to both represent and offer independent support or advice on equality issues. All enquiries are kept in the strictest confidence – please feel free to contact me.
